It didn't in this instance but if a version of a program is working and subsequent changes make the program stop functioning as intended; isolating just the changes can save a lot of time and digging through code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If significant changes are made that for whatever reason break some function of the program the version could be rolled back while fixing the bugs in the newer version.

Code optimization.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The types of files google docs deals with are not typically interdependent.
